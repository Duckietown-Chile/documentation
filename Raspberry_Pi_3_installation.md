# Raspberry Pi 3 Installation and configuration

## Image creation
We use Ubuntu Mate 16.04 available [here](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/). According to the documentation, it has no issues with Wifi nor bluetooth.

## Ubuntu configuration
A clean installation of Ubuntu Mate 16 requires user creation and configuration via a GUI wizard pretty similar to a custom Ubuntu installation. Hence, it is recommended to use a display to configure this stuff.

We set the following configuration for our duckiebots in the wizard:
    user: duckiebot
    password: quackquack (however, we also set it to log in automatically)
